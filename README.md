# Space-Education-Game
This is a fun and interactive space education game. 

How to play: Run "space.java" to start up the game. Press the space bar or click the "play" button to start. 

Controls: Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship to the left and right. Use the space bar to fire your laser
at the enemy ships.

Objective: The purpose of the game is to make the number beside "Total:" equal the number that is above the boss
alien at the middle of the top of the screen. You can arrive at this number by shooting at the operators wheel in the middle
of the screen to select your desired operator. You can then shoot the smaller enemy ships to add, subtract, multiply and
divide depending on which operator you have selected. Each time you shoot a new number, it will manipulate your running total.
Once you match your total with the boss number at the top of the screen, the boss will explode and a new boss will come
into the screen with a new number. But watch out for the enemy ship's lasers and the boss laser!

Note: Dividing by zero may have consequences.
